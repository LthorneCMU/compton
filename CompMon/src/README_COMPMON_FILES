Description of files used for integrating compton DAQ

mainanal_CompMon.cc
    (look here first to see program flow)
    opens input CODA data file and output root file
    loops on events.

Classes:

comptonParams
   accessable by other classes, use this for run-number dependent perameters
   such as BeamOn thresholds, helicity delay histogram limits, etc.
   Very messy right now, but we can clean it up.  Could be used to read
   a database instead but probably not necessary.
   Edit comptonParams.cc to change parameters.

comptonStatus
   analyzes auxillary data, helicity bit etc. to determine the status of
   each MPS.  i.e laser state (on/off, left/right)  helicty state (including
   ability to look ahead when running with delayed trigger0.  BeamOn, etc.
   Also where we are in a MPS helicity quad and in a laser cycle.
   
fadcTriggered
    Handles triggered data with multiple triggers per MPS.
      This includes fadc data pre-summed (pusle data) and waveform samples.
      Includes filling of histograms that show MPS events, triggers, etc.
      sorted by Laser On, Laser Off, helicity,e tc.

fadcAccums
     Handles accumulator data.  Not much in here at the moment.

fadcdata
     handles unpacking of fadc data.  This Class understands the CODA subbank
     structures used for the integrating compton  (the accumulator banks,
      the triggered summed-pulses, and the waveform samples.)

vmeauxdata
    handles unpacking of auxillary info  from the VME crate, including the scalers.

epcisCompton
    used for EPICS events to pull out the integrating-daq EPICS info.

Standard Hall A stuff
THaCodaData, THaCodaFile, THaEpics
    these Classes understand the basic CODA structure but not the compton-specific
    information.

Structures
  bankstructure.h
     holds info  for a specific CODA subbank  (not compton-specific)
  pulsestructure.h
     holds info for an fadc sampled waveform.
